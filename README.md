# Payroll

The purpose of app to implement a Payroll system in multiple currencies.

### TODO / Possible improvements

- Allow employees to change payment period, and of course adapt time restriction for `payday` to it. (Thanks to @monicazng !)
- Would it be better to define allowed tokens only globally instead of per employee? Not sure, pros and cons, needs more discussion about use cases. Roughly: per employee if makes sense to allow different tokens for different employees; globally would make way easier to add (or remove) allowed tokens.
- Finish documentation and move it to [Aragon's wiki](https://wiki.aragon.one)
